              <p>This bar chart tells us people who have hypertension have a higher chance of getting a stroke compared to people who don’t have hypertension. The stroke column is set as 0 for no stroke and 1 for stroke which is why the values in the y-axis are only decimals. Interesting part is, males who don’t have hypertension have a small higher chance of getting a stroke compared to females who don’t have hypertension. It reverses for the genders for people who have hypertension but the difference between females and males is a bit higher.

It is not saying you shouldn’t get married so you have a less chance of getting a stroke. People who usually get married are older than people who aren’t married which is probably one of the reasons why married people is way higher than not married people.
