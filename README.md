Stroke affects 15 million people worldwide each year and out of those 15 million people, about 5 miliion die.

Two of our data sets were found in Kaggle and the third data set was found in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In our analysis, we found a stroke and cardiovascular disease data set that provides patient demographics, life-style habits and specific health indicators that can identify if they are likely to experience a cardiovascular disease, specifically a stroke. The mortality data set provides information of the total number of people who died from a stroke in each state. Our objective here is to analyze what factors could lead to someone having a stroke and the likelihood of that person having a stroke.
